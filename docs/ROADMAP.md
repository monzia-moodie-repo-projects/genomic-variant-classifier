# GenAssoc / genomic-variant-classifier - Living Roadmap

**Version: 2026-06-09 (v2)  |  Owner: Monzia Moodie**

Repo: github.com/monzia-moodie-repo-projects/genomic-variant-classifier

*Authoritative source of truth; supersedes phase language in prior session docs. Updated at the end of every session; Drive copy via rclone genvarcla:.*

*v2 note: Run 15 completed (full cohort, ESM-2 mechanically active, constraint columns revived, unseen-gene-holdout ablation). Findings folded into the snapshot, data-source registry, and immediate plan below.*

# 1. Project identity & goals

Production-grade multi-modal genomic disease-association program. Core: an ACMG/AMP-style variant pathogenicity classifier over ~1.49M cohort rows (from ~2.49M ClinVar missense), 79 features, 13-model ensemble + stacking meta-learner + STRING-DB GNN + KAN.

**Dual goal (both first-class):**

- Classify variants and infer disease categories/phenotypes.

- Empirically measure/compare/validate ML algorithms on large complex data, incl. KAN/GNN/GraphGPS, even at small performance differences.

**Default stance: implement / keep / study. Never drop models/features on marginal-AUROC grounds.**

# 2. Phase model

| **Phase** | **Name** | **Scope** | **Legacy label** | **State** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F | Foundation | Bug-fixed core, ensemble+GNN+KAN, real ClinVar | Phase 1 / Phase 0 | DONE |
| D | Data expansion | Wire sources; activate dead columns; add new sources | Phase 2 (partly) | IN PROGRESS |
| P | Performance/infra | Polars layer; Rust inference service | roadmap 3/5 | NOT STARTED |
| A | Advanced modeling | Julia training, VAE, Bayesian UQ, GraphGPS | roadmap 4 | NOT STARTED |
| X | Productionization | REST API, Docker, clinical eval/report | Phase 2 (API/Docker) | NOT STARTED |

*We are in Phase D (data expansion). Foundation is done.*

# 3. Current state snapshot (2026-06-09)

- **Run 15 SEALED (commit 032a2ab):** Test AUROC 0.9984, Val 0.9983, AUPRC 0.9935/0.9919, MCC 0.9655/0.9614, Brier 0.0069/0.0071. Cohort Train 1,038,974 / Val 146,329 / Test 304,711; 79 features. ~11.5 h on RTX 4090, ~$6.

- **Unseen-gene-holdout ablation: ENSEMBLE_STACKER AUROC 0.9988** on 213,436 rows / 2,407 gene-disjoint genes (C3 falsifier (b) PASS vs 0.95). Strong generalization to unseen genes; the corpus-scope leakage question on n_pathogenic_in_gene remains open (see §5).

- **ESM-2 mechanically active** (local UniProt index, no run-time REST, GPU auto-detect; commits 7b267ea/032a2ab) BUT coverage is only ~3,451/~1.49M (HGVSp-parser gap). esm2_delta_norm is ~99.7% zero in the full run; current AUROCs rest on tabular + constraint features.

- **gene_constraint_oe REVIVED** (Run-14 all-zero -> Run-15 #2 feature) via loeuf->oe derivation patch. **gnn_score REAL** (non-degeneracy gate PASS). cnn_1d (0.85) and kan (0.996) recovered from smoke underfit.

- **AlphaMissense OOM fixed** (325b0d2, re-validated): 71.7M rows parsed in ~2 min via cohort-filter-during-parse.

- Suite: 804 passed / 1 skipped.

# 4. Data-source registry

## 4A. Wired & healthy

ClinVar (labels+cohort), gnomAD v4 (LOEUF, pLI, AF, **mis_z, syn_z, gene_constraint_oe**), AlphaMissense, SpliceAI, dbNSFP (SIFT/CADD/REVEL/GERP/PolyPhen), STRING-DB v12 (GNN -> gnn_score, confirmed real), n_pathogenic_in_gene, Reactome (reactome_pathway_count, wired 2026-06-08).

## 4B. Scaffolded but DEAD / partial (Phase D targets)

| **Source** | **Dead/partial column(s)** | **Access** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ESM-2 | esm2_delta_norm | local model+index | MECHANICALLY ACTIVE; coverage ~3,451 only -> **gated on HGVSp parser** |
| PhyloP | phylop_score | free bigWig | conservation |
| GTEx | gtex_* (6) | free | eQTL/expression |
| 1000 Genomes | af_1kg_* (5) | free VCF | population AF |
| dbSNP/RefSNP | dbsnp_af | free | stub-mode step; activation = data + config |
| AlphaFold structure | alphafold_plddt, solvent_accessibility, secondary_structure_context, dist_to_active_site, has_uniprot_annotation | free (AlphaFold DB) | stub-mode step; activation = data + config |
| OMIM | omim_* (2) | free academic w/ reg. | disease/inheritance |
| ClinGen | clingen_validity_score | free API | **dtype drift: int vs float across prep/inference - fix before regen** |
| FinnGen | finngen_* (3) | free summary | population enrichment |
| MaxEntScan | maxentscan_score | free tool | splice strength |
| VEP | codon_position, exon_number | free tool | coding context |
| EVE | eve_score | free score files | needs score files + HGVSp coords |
| HGMD | hgmd_* (2) | PAID, blocked | label-leakage rules |
| LOVD | lovd_variant_class | free | tiny coverage |

*Note: gene_constraint_oe / gene_is_constrained moved OUT of 4B (constraint vestige resolved; oe now healthy and #2 feature).*

## 4C. New candidates - verdicts (unchanged from v1)

Strong fits: AlphaFold DB (DO), RefSNP/dbSNP (DO), COSMIC (DO, academic; feature NOT label), TCGA (OPTIONAL), Reactome (DONE), KEGG (OPTIONAL, overlaps Reactome). BioGRID overlaps STRING. dbGaP is an access prerequisite (blocked), not a connector. ProteomeXchange / SRA / ENA / DDBJ DRA / SILVA out of scope.

# 5. Immediate plan

- **HGVSp parser (highest leverage, empirically confirmed by Run 15):** populate protein_pos/wt_aa/mut_aa across the cohort to lift ESM-2 (and EVE) coverage from ~3,451 to ~1M. Until then ESM-2 carries no real full-run signal.

- **n_pathogenic_in_gene computation-scope audit:** confirm train-only-per-fold vs corpus-wide; recompute train-only if corpus-wide, to close the leakage question the UGH 0.9988 result left open.

- **Fix clingen_validity_score dtype drift** (int in real_data_prep vs float in variant_ensemble) before the next regen.

- Remaining Phase-D connectors: activate dbSNP + AlphaFold-structure stub steps (data + config), then build COSMIC / TCGA / KEGG.

- One comprehensive GPU regen after the accessible public connectors are wired; measure-first probe; ALL-MODELS smoke before any billable retrain.

# 6. Modeling & infra roadmap

- Ensemble: RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM (nystrom + bagged_rbf), LR, GBM, 1D-CNN, TabularNN + meta-learner; CatBoost; MC-Dropout; Deep Ensemble; KAN. Per-model comparison every run.

- GNN (Phase D/A): bf16 AMP, PyG SparseTensor/CSR, GraphGPS, Laplacian PE/RWSE, 3-channel STRING weights. GPU-only; 2-epoch probe first.

- CatBoost GPU-memory hardening (empty_cache between families / expandable_segments / order before torch models).

- Performance (P): Polars; Rust inference service. Advanced (A): Julia, VAE, Bayesian UQ. Productionization (X): REST API, Docker, clinical eval/report.

# 7. Standing disciplines

- Pre-flight gate; local mini-test before cloud; goal realignment each run.

- Measure-first (no estimates without a probe); ALL-MODELS smoke before training.

- Incremental checkpointing; irreversible/cloud cmds in separate re-paste blocks.

- Count-guarded, backup-first, idempotent, sandbox-validated patchers; byte-IO on Windows.

- **Background launch over SSH uses `< /dev/null`; read-only SSH checks use `-n -o ConnectTimeout=20 -o BatchMode=yes`; single-quoted SSH bodies; single-word grep patterns.**

- Document every run (algorithm comparison + metrics glossary); keep this roadmap current.

- Never drop models/features; scope ambiguity -> STOP + ask with options + pros/cons.

# 8. Blockers

- HGMD Professional - procurement; REVEL/VEST4/FATHMM/MutPred2 not labels if HGMD is a label source.

- dbGaP / TOPMed / controlled-TCGA / CPTAC-protected - need institutional Signing Official; blocked w/o R1 faculty sponsor.

- EVE - needs score files + HGVSp coords before eve_score is real.

# 9. Changelog

- 2026-06-09 (v2): Run 15 sealed (Test 0.9984 / Val 0.9983 / UGH 0.9988). ESM-2 stall fixed + shipped (local index + GPU), but coverage ~3,451 -> HGVSp parser promoted to top Phase-D item. AlphaMissense OOM re-validated. gene_constraint_oe revived (#2 feature); gnn_score confirmed real; cnn_1d/kan recovered. Infra lessons (SSH stdin-detach, fast-fail flags, poll-bail bug) recorded. clingen dtype drift flagged.

- 2026-06-08 (v1 re-baseline): roadmap reconstructed; phase model proposed; data-source registry added (incl. out-of-scope determinations + dbGaP clarification); split-health audit + constraint vestige recorded; ESM-2 GPU-regen plan set.
