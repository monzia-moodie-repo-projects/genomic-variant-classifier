# Changelog — Genomic Variant Classifier

Append-only. One entry per session. Captures what was attempted, what
failed (with exact errors and root causes), what was fixed, and what was
learned. Searchable: paste any error string to find the root cause and fix.

## 2026-04-08 — Runs 6 & 7, GPU quota request, Run 8 startup script

### Attempted
- Run 6: full training on GCP (n2-highmem-32, CPU-only). Holdout AUROC 0.9862.
- Run 7: repeat with gnomAD v4.1 constraint features wired in. AUROC 0.9862 (unchanged — GNN still CPU-only).
- GPU quota request: GPUS_ALL_REGIONS = 1.
- Run 8 VM create: L4 (g2-standard-8).

### Failed
- Run 6 models lost: VM was deleted before model upload was confirmed.
  Root cause: shutdown was triggered by `&&` chaining, not `trap EXIT`.
  `&&` only fires on success; VM was already off by the time we checked GCS.
- GPU quota denied. Code: GPUS_ALL_REGIONS = 0 (new account, no billing history).
- Run 8 VM create failed: `ZONE_RESOURCE_POOL_EXHAUSTED` across all US zones.
  Root cause: quota was 0 — zone exhaustion was a red herring.
- venv torch install on Deep Learning VM: `libcusparseLt.so.0` not found.
  Root cause: venv doesn't have access to the system CUDA libraries.
  Fix: uninstall pip torch from venv; add .pth bridge to system torch.
- `gcloud storage cp -r` added extra directory nesting level.
  Fix: use individual file copies, not `-r`.
- `set -euo pipefail` in startup script caused silent exits on risky commands.
  Fix: wrap risky commands with `|| true`.

### Fixed
- Startup script: replaced `&&` chaining with `trap 'upload && shutdown' EXIT`.
  Fires on ANY exit: success, failure, crash, OOM.
- Git safe.directory: `git config --global --add safe.directory $REPO_DIR`
  (startup runs as root; repo cloned as monzi — git refuses pull otherwise).
- Parallel composite upload disabled: `gcloud config set storage/parallel_composite_upload_enabled False`.
  Was causing 401 auth failures on large files when OAuth token expired mid-upload.
- argparse `--string-db` flag: was missing from `run_phase2_eval.py`.
- gnomAD constraint path: was never wired into `AnnotationConfig`.
  All four constraint features (loeuf, syn_z, mis_z, pli_score) defaulted to 0.

### Learned
- Always verify models are in GCS before stopping/deleting a VM.
- `trap EXIT` is the only correct pattern. `&&` is insufficient.
- Google grants GPU quota only after billing history is established.
  Reapply after 2026-04-15.
- `gcloud storage` CLI always; never `gsutil` (does not read project from config).

## 2026-04-09 — Inter-run items 1-8, inter-agent message bus (Phase 4)

### Attempted
- SpliceAI index build from full hg38 VCF (28.8GB compressed).
- VersionMonitorAgent implementation and orchestrator wiring.
- Requirements cleanup (orphan files, add transformers>=4.40).
- Dockerfile audit and fixes.
- Polars benchmark on gnomAD constraint join.
- .gitkeep replacement in data/ subdirs.
- Inter-agent message bus: OpenClaw-inspired typed message passing between all 4 agents.
- Full pipeline dry-run verification.

### Failed
- SpliceAI VCF was misidentified as masked SNV (~72M lines).
  Actual: full unmasked hg38 VCF including indels — 1.1B+ lines, 2.5+ hours.
  Root cause: filename says "masked.snv" but file is full genome-wide.
  Result: still correct and more complete than expected. Build still running at session end.
- Docker smoke test: Docker Desktop not running (Linux engine pipe not found).
  Not a code problem. Deferred.
- `data_freshness_agent.py`: `ImportError: cannot import name 'ALPHAMISSENSE_MANIFEST_URL'`.
  Root cause: config has `ALPHAMISSENSE_MANIFEST`, not `ALPHAMISSENSE_MANIFEST_URL`.
  Fix: align agent import to real config constant name.
- `training_lifecycle_agent.py`: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ewc_utils'`.
  Root cause: top-level import; ewc_utils lives in agents/ not agent_layer/.
  Fix: lazy import inside `_check_drift()` method.
- `literature_scout_agent.py`: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'feedparser'`.
  Fix: lazy import inside `_fetch_biorxiv()`.
- `literature_scout_agent.py`: `NameError: name '_TRAINING_AGENT' is not defined`.
  Root cause: constant dropped during config-name reconciliation pass.
  Fix: re-add `_TRAINING_AGENT = "TrainingLifecycleAgent"` constant.
- LOVD REST API: HTTP 402 (unsupported) on all polls.
  Root cause: LOVD changed their API terms. Logged as warning, skipped gracefully.
- ClinGen API: 404 (endpoint URL format changed).
  Logged as warning, skipped gracefully.
- PubMed efetch: occasional 500 Server Error (NCBI transient).
  Logged as warning, skipped gracefully.

### Fixed
- All 8 inter-run items completed and committed.
- Inter-agent message bus: 34/34 tests passing on Python 3.14.3.
- Full pipeline `--dry-run` confirmed working: all 4 agents run cleanly with
  graceful degradation where ewc_utils/feedparser not on path.

### Learned
- SpliceAI "masked.snv" filename is misleading — always check file size first.
  28.8GB compressed = full genome-wide VCF, not masked SNVs only.
- Polars join 3.3x faster than pandas merge on gnomAD constraint join (500K variants).
  Integration approved for Phase 3 ETL bottlenecks.
- Inter-agent messaging with lazy imports is the correct pattern for an agent layer
  where not all dependencies are always installed.
- PowerShell `<` operator is reserved — never use `<placeholder>` syntax in commands.
  Always use a real value or `PLACEHOLDER_VALUE` without angle brackets.
